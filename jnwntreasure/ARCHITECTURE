	The Java port of NeverWinter Nights uses two main Design Patterns.  
	One is from the classic book Design Patterns, by the Gang of Four, 
called the Mediator pattern.  As I understand it a Mediator is an object that
controls the interaction between two or more software objects, thereby 
increasing maintainability and reuse of the mediated objects.  In this case,
the Mediators I have created handle the interaction between the main GUI 
elements in the program and the data objects those GUIs are used to 
construct.  
	The other pattern I have used is basically a Mediator pattern on a 
larger scale.  This architecture level pattern is called PAC, Presentation-
Abstraction-Control, a twist on the more popular MVC, Model-View-Controller.
The Presentation component in the PAC pattern is the analog of the View 
component of the MVC pattern, the Control component mirrors the Controller, 
and the Abstraction component mirrors the Model.  The difference with the 
PAC pattern is that the Presentation and Abstraction components do not 
communicate with one another directly.  Instead they do it through the 
Control component.  Furthermore, a software system that is composed of PAC 
subsystems conducts communication between PAC subsystems via Control 
components.
	It might have also been useful to make some of the dialogs Singletons because they are modal to begin with.  However, I figured that a Java program has a larger than average memory footprint to begin with, so Singletons would be even more wasteful.
	As a result of my understanding and use of these patterns, the GUI 
and data object classes in this design are very light weight.  The GUI 
classes only have get methods.  The data objects only have set and get 
methods.  These data objects provide no other services.

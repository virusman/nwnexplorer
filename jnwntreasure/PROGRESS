	So far, the Java port of Neverwinter Nights Treasure Editor doesn't do much.  The more I do porting this program, the more I find I have to do.

To this point, a user can do the following :

	For Placeables:

		Add a Placeable Table
		Delete a Placeable Table
		Bring up the Placeable Item dialog
		Switch between Placeable Item Panels
		Start the script tree over again.
		

The next major hurdle :

	Adding a placeable item apparently requires parsing NWN data files for object blueprints.  This parsing is the next hurdle I hope to clear.  I don't know how long this is going to take.  However, I did notice a C union in the data structures that need to be parsed.  I barely know what a union does in C, so emulating it in Java may be a neat trick.

	This is a Java port of the NWN Treasure Editor created by Torlack, 
www.torlack.com.  The process of compiling and running this application
has been automated with Ant, (found at ant.apache.org), for reasons of symmetry 
and ease of development.  A  Makefile is also included, and it actually does 
things a bit faster.  The Makefile has the same capabilities as the Ant build
file.
	To use Ant: 

		Unpackage the Ant tar ball :

			cd /where/you/want/to/put/Ant
			tar xvzf apache-ant-1.6.1-bin.tar.gz

		Define two environmental variables :

			JAVA_HOME, the location of your JDK.  To figure out 
			what the value of this variable should be, type :
			'which javac' at a command prompt.  For Mac OS X,
			this should produce /usr/bin/javac.  So the value
			of JAVA_HOME would be /usr.

			ANT_HOME, where ever you put Ant.  In this case
			you would put the full path (e.g. 
			/usr/local/apache-ant-1.6.1).

		Put Ant in your path
			For sh/bash:
				export PATH=$PATH:$ANT_HOME/bin
			For csh/tcsh
				set path=($path $ANT_HOME/bin)	
			

	To run jnwntreasure with Ant, in the jnwntreasure directory (where this
README is found), simply type :

	ant

	If you want to run jnwntreasure directly with java, the easiest way is 
via the jar file.  To do this, in the jnwntreasure directory (where this README 
is found), type :

	java -jar jar/jnwntreasure.jar

	The JAR file knows how to find the starting class.	

	For those that have used Ant before, the build.xml file contains the 
following targets:

		init - cleans up all .class files
		compile - compiles the application
		make_jar - creates a JAR file for the application
		run - runs the application from the JAR file
		docs - creates documentation for the code via javadoc

	A Makefile has also been created.  To run jnwntreasure from the 
Makefile, in the jnwntreasure directory (where this README is found), type :
		
		make run

	The Makefile has the following targets :

		compile - compiles the code
		jar - creates a jar file from the compiled code
		javadoc - creates documentation for the code via javadoc
		run - runs the program via the jar file

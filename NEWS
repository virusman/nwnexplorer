NWN Tools 2.1.0
===============

* The compiler has been updated to support Hordes of the Underdark.
* Constructs involving '|=', '&=', etc now compile correctly.
* The compiler now returns an exit flag of 1 if there are any errors during
  compile.
* There is now a python wrapper for the compiler in nwnnsscompiler/python.
  This is used for integration into neveredit.

NWN Tools 2.0.0
===============

This is the first release of NWN Tools under the Open Knights Consortium flag.
We hope to be able to maintain the quality of work of the original author and
live up to the expectations of the users.

NWN Tools 1.2 and earlier versions
==================================

These versions were developped by Edward T. Smith (a.k.a. Torlack) and were
distributed on his website at:  http://www.torlack.com/

March 12th, 2003:

 * Blank statements after an if or else statement will now generate a warning.
 * The compiler will automatically ignore requests to include the same include
   file multiple times in a script compilation.
 * With the non-Windows versions, if the path specified for the NWN directory
   doesn't end in a "/", one will be automatically added.
 * All the libraries and the model converter have been converted to build with
   GCC.
 * Corrected a problem with the script decompiler regarding the TALENT type.

April 23rd, 2003:

 * On GCC systems, the script compiler optimizer might throw an assert. The
   code has been modified to prevent the assert which was non-fatal in nature.
 * On some GCC systems, the basename routine is declared as having a "char *"
   argument. The only place where this caused a problem has been modified to
   force the type to "char *". A future version will have a better fix for this
   problem.
 * If a function declaration has more arguments than the prototype, the
   compiler would fail to generate an error. This would result in a compiled
   script that runs the risk of generating "STACK UNDERFLOW" errors.
 * Corrected a bug in the script compiler that would fail to generate an error
   when a function was called without enough parameters.

July 1st, 2003:

 * Added the new -v command line argument to the script compiler. This allows
   for the compiler to compile files using older compiler rules.
 * The script compiler now generates the new script debug file (NDB).
 * A '.' (dot) in the input path which is not part of the extension will no
   longer confuse the model and script compiler.
 * The default directory for including script includes will be the same
   directory as the input script.
 * The script decompiler now supports the new NOP opcode.
 * Corrected a script compiler crash caused by some types of syntax errors.
 * Increased the maximum size of a compiled script to 512k to match BioWare
   maximum script size.
 * Added support for SoU key files.
